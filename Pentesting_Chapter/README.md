## Intro

A cybersecurity professional, the pentester checks the security of computer networks by carrying out penetration tests. He identifies vulnerabilities and proposes actions to correct them.

## Pentester's missions

Companies that are more and more prone to cyberthreats must have cybersecurity experts capable of thinking in the same way as their potential attackers, in order to limit and anticipate as much as possible malicious flaws and intrusions into their computer systems.

The pentester is a computer security professional whose mission is to "voluntarily" infiltrate a network or a computer application in order to evaluate its security level.

His approach is similar to that of the hacker, using the same techniques and approaches as the malicious hacker, but diverting them for the benefit of the company.
 
The pentester will perform penetration tests to verify the company's IT security and provide solutions to reduce the vulnerability of the systems.

## Intrusion tests & scans vulnerabilities

A penetration test, or pentest, is a method that consists of analyzing a target by putting oneself in the shoes of an attacker.

This target can be an IP, an application, a web server, or a complete network.

Vulnerability scanning, different from penetration testing, is in fact a component of penetration testing, i.e. a sub-part. More precisely, it is a scan of the target that allows one to enumerate the vulnerabilities, without trying to qualify them or to check if they are exploitable.

Penetration tests have clear objectives:

- Identify the vulnerabilities of the IS or its application;
- Assess the degree of risk of each identified vulnerability;
- Propose corrective measures in a prioritized manner.

Thanks to the penetration test, the pentester can qualify the severity of the vulnerability, the complexity of the correction, and the order of priority to be given to the corrections.

In order to secure the infrastructure or the application, penetration tests can be performed at different times in the life of a company. Thus, they can be initiated during the project design phase, in order to anticipate possible attacks, during the use phase, at regular intervals, and finally, following a cyber attack so that it does not happen again.

The penetration test can be done from the outside (external penetration test). This penetration test can be performed from any Internet connection.

The intrusion test can also be done from inside the infrastructure (internal intrusion test). In this case, the test will be performed on the LAN (internal network of the company).

With these provisions, the pentester evaluates the vulnerabilities and tries to attack the system. The defense systems, i.e. antivirus and firewalls, are bypassed by the tools used for the intrusion.

Finally, the missions of the pentester can go beyond a computer system intrusion test. They can be concerned about all the equipment available to the company. Thus, the pentester can also carry out complete audits for the company. There are several types:

- Code audits: The source code of an application is analyzed to identify any security flaws.
- Configuration audits: The configuration of a system or network equipment is provided to the pentester, which then compares this data to official reference documents (CIS, NIST guides, etc.) to identify any compliance gaps.
- Architecture audits: The pentester verifies the robustness of the architecture of an information system in the face of various threats. This is done from customer architecture documents and interviews.
- Organizational audit: The pentester verifies the organization put in place by the customer from a security point of view, from the creation of a team dedicated to incident management, based on available documents and interviews with the customer.

## Pentesting steps

* Pre-engagement: This is surely the phase that many novices will neglect/forget, wrongly, because it is during this phase that we will define the scope of the test and the methods that will be used for it.

* Reconnaissance: Collecting as much publically accessible information about the target as possible.

* Enumeration/Scanning: Discover the applications and services running on the systems, and scan the ports (it's time for Nmap).

* Exploitation: Exploit vulnerabilities discovered on a system or application either via public exploits or via exploitation of the application/system logic.

* Privilege Escalation: Once you have successfully exploited a system or application, a foothold in the jargon, you need to extend your access to the system. We talk about horizontal and vertical escalation, Horizontal escalation corresponds to a transition to another user with the same permissions, whereas vertical escalation corresponds to access to admin permissions.

* Post-exploitation: This phase is broken down into several sub-steps:

    - Full privilege collection: Additional information with a high-privileged user.

    - Pivoting: Check of other potential targets.

    - Clean-up: Erase the traces of your intrusion.

    - Reporting: Report harvesters, the flaws discovered, the methods used, the paths, the tools, the commands, or any other relevant information that can be used in the last phase.

    - Remediation: Fixing and proposing solutions for all vulnerabilities identified during the reporting phase.
