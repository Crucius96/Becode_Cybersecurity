# Passive and Active Information Gathering

In this chapter I went through a series of tools and methodologies in order to gather information regarding a specific target (victim/company).

In the [Passive]() information gathering or also known as Reconnaissance : Collecting as much publically accessible information about the target as possible.

In the [Active]() information gathering or also known as Enumeration/Scanning : Discover the applications and services running on the systems, scan the ports (it's time for nmap and other tools).
