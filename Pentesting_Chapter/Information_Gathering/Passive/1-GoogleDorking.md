## What ?

Google is the most used search engine in the world and is surely the best, even if we can reproach a lot of things to its privacy policy or to the use that the company makes of our data , in our environment, it is a quality ally, let's see why...

### Some statistics

- It has 90% of the search engine market share, the only countries where he is not a leader are, not surprisingly, Russia and China.

- There are more than 130 000 billion pages indexed by google.

- Google crawls over 20 billion pages per day.

- Google is also 80,000 queries every second or 6.9 billion per day, in short, more than 2000 billion per year.

As you can see, when it comes to information research, google becomes a very interesting database to exploit ...

### How to use it ?

Google uses its own syntax to search its database. This is very powerful to refine our searches, and we will work on this.

**First, some tips**

- In English : It seems obvious but you will always find more content

- Make it simple : Use only keywords, no need for long sentences.

- Use the operators : "", ., OR, AND, *, NOT, ~, ().

- Use the prefixes (advanced search operators) : site:, filetype:, cache:, and more, there are many, some are deprecated, some are more efficient than others but some combination can be very useful for a targeted search.

- Don't forget to use the image search too !

### What is dorking ?

It is precisely the set of search possibilities with Google's own syntax that allows you to make very targeted searches of websites, we talk about Google Dorking.

For example, we can find sensitive information such as emails, passwords, hidden files...
Identify authentication pages.
Search for hardware connected to the Internet (cameras, routers, printers, ...)
Check misconfigured web servers
Target web server related tools like phpmyadmin, phpinfo(), site administration...
Find vulnerabilities that allow to hack the target.

You can consult the following [page](https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database) if you want to have an overview of the possibilities ;)

## Check

Let's start with a little introduction (very informative and interesting video)

As of 31/08/2023, Mr. Nguyen is the current Sr. Network Engineer at Walt Disney Animation Studios:
`site:linkedin.com intitle: Walt Disney Animation "sr. network engineer"`

You can also ask Google exactly what you want and it also gave me the same answer: "who is disney animation's current sr. network engineer?"
