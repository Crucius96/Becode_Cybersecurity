This last challenge is more a little game than anything else but first let me give you the context and framework

- Type : Solo, Team
- Duration : Not define

1. This challenge is a mix of osint and treasure hunt like an escape game, you will be able to rework the tools you have discovered in this course but there may also be some surprises...

2. We will work as in a real CTF, so it is both, a solo game but also a team game, for some stages you will need the others to progress.

3. This challenge will last until the end of your training, the real question is will anyone manage to take the last step ?

4. There will be a reward, there is always a reward, it will be equal to the efforts that the winner will have provided !

Ready ? Good luck ;)
