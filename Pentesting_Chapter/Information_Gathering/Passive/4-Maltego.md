## Learning objectives

## OSINT or WEBINT ?

* Maltego is an open-source intelligence and graphical link analysis tool for gathering and connecting information for investigative tasks.

The OSINT is most valuable when the data collected for its production is properly exploited, analyzed, and verified. However, the intelligence cycle—collection, filtering, analysis, production— tends to be very time-intensive since the raw data is often unstructured. This is where WEBINT comes in.

The WEBINT, is the means to “efficiently identify the intelligence available via OSINT” by normalizing or providing structure to the unstructured information that is collected from the internet.

And that's where maltego comes into play !
