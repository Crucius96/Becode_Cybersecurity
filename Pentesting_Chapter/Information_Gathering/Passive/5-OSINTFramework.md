## What ?

It's the best of all tools, your best friend, not only because it contains all the tools we have worked on but much more !

As its name suggests, it's a framework. It provides a simple web-based interface, which contains a collection of OSINT tools to make your intel and data collection tasks easier. All in the form of a cheat sheet with a cluster structure, very practical considering the amount of information and it's a format more than appreciable.On top of that, it is totally open-source.

As you will have understood, the most complicated thing with OSINT is to know where to look and with what, one does not screw with a hammer and one does not nail with a screwdriver. Well, with this tool you have a roadmap to go around these tools without forgetting any information categories

## How to use it ?

Nothing could be easier, there are two ways to use this tool, either to target specific information quickly, or to launch your search and investigation of all open sources.

Therefore, in the first case, you can directly find the appropriate tools and in the second, you can browse the whole tree point by point and gather/overlap/sort/filter your information.

You find tools like Shodan, Maltego but also others like Metagoofil for, babe X to search in other languages, searchcode to explore source codes and many others

**NB : Disclaimer**

You will find a category dedicated to the darkweb and to everything that is not indextracted, be careful on the measures to take before exploiting this kind of research

### Contribution !

- As I said, this is an open-source project, you can contribute to it if you have a tool to propose or an update to submit on one of the references [Github link](https://github.com/lockfale/osint-framework)

### Check

- Before we get into the challenges, you can watch this video which gives you a good overview of the resources you have exploited and the field to cover during the passive reconnaissance phase : [Osint tuto](https://youtu.be/qwA6MmbeGNo), it also gives you a glimpse of the techniques that we did not use during this course but that may come, I do not know...
