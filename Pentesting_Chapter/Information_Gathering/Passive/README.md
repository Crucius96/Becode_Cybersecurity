## Pentesting steps

* Pre-engagement : This is surely the phase that many novices will neglect/forget, wrongly, because it is during this phase that we will define the scope of the test and the methods that will be used for it.

* **Reconnaissance** : Collecting as much publically accessible information about the target as possible.

* Enumeration/Scanning : Discover the applications and services running on the systems, scan the ports (it's time for nmap).

* Exploitation : Exploit vulnerabilities discovered on a system or application either via public exploits or via exploitation of the application/system logic.

* Privilege Escalation : Once you have successfully exploited a system or application, a foothold in the jargon, you need to extend your access to the system. We talk about horizontal and vertical escalation, horizontal escalation corresponds to a transition to another user with the same permissions, vertical escalation corresponds to access to admin permissions.

* Post-exploitation : This phase is broken down into several sub-steps:

    - Full privilege collection : Additional information with a high-privileged user.

    - Pivoting : Check of other potential targets.

    - Clean-up : Erase the traces of your intrusion.

    - Reporting : Report harvesters, the flaws that have been discovered, the methods used, the paths, the tools, the commands, or any other relevant information that can be used in the last phase.

    - Remediation : Fixing and proposing solutions for all vulnerabilities that were identified during the reporting phase.

*NB : I am attaching the [OSSTMM](./assets/OSSTMM.pdf), "The Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual" so that you can have a more detailed overview of the whole process, you can find other processes or with a slightly different breakdown but in general, don't bother with it, it will always be the same.*

## So ?

Technically, the reconnaissance phase and the enumeration phase are part of the same whole, which is called information gathering, nevertheless, we must distinguish between passive information gathering (reconnaissance) and active information gathering (enumeration).
For this chapter, we will focus on **passive information gathering**, that is, all the information that we can retrieve in a public way and that does not require any intervention on the system or on the target identified in the scope.

## Intro

You will have understood it but in a general way on this course we will work on the "OSINT".

So, first of all, what is the osint : *Open-source intelligence (OSINT) is the collection and analysis of data gathered from open sources (overt and publicly available sources) to produce actionable intelligence. OSINT is primarily used in national security, law enforcement, and business intelligence functions and is of value to analysts who use non-sensitive intelligence in answering classified, unclassified, or proprietary intelligence requirements across the previous intelligence disciplines.* #Wikipedia

In short, it corresponds to all the information that can be found on the target in a public way, that is to say, which does not require any particular technical skill, it is used in the cyber but not only, it's also used in journalism and in judicial investigations for example...

To find this information we will work on several tools and several layers of the web, the referenced content, the non-referenced content but also the one we try to hide.

To make it easier for you, *osint* has a complete framework [Osint framework](https://osintframework.com/) but in this course, we will work on some of them to better understand their functions and characteristics.

## Demo

A short demo ? Okay, to give you some context, in this video, we find *osint* but also *geoint*, a subtype of osint, where the search is oriented on an image and its position.
