# Browsing Internet resources

## Website
The first technique to use when gathering information is to surf the company's website for information that could facilitate an attack, such as the software the company uses or the email addresses and phone numbers of company employees that you could use in a social engineering attack.
Look for web pages, such as About Us, Jobs, or Careers, that might provide information such as names, phone numbers, and email addresses of employees or senior management. This is great information to use in a social engineering attack. In addition, a Jobs or Careers page can list active jobs that could help you understand the technologies used by the company. For example, if the company is looking for an Exchange Server 2016 email administrator, you know that the company is most likely running Exchange Server 2016.

## Social media  
Billions of people have profiles on social networking sites. And a significant percentage of them upload content underpinned by rich data. For example, a single image posted to a social networking platform can include geolocation, metadata and camera serial numbers.

That’s not to say social media intelligence is comprehensive. After all, it only represents a minute portion of the data held on the internet.

However, social media intelligence is actionable and often progresses criminal cases towards positive conclusions. This is because, by connecting fragments of data, law enforcement can work out a suspect’s whereabouts and activities.

Aside from images, these data fragments can come from videos, location check-ins and tags from different social media platforms.

## Whois

Whois is a search service provided by Internet registries, such as regional Internet registries or domain name registries, to obtain information about an IP address or a domain name.

Thousands of times a day, domains are purchased and/or transferred between individuals. The procedure for this to happen is simple and takes only a few minutes and about $7 depending on the registration service provider. In addition to payment details, you must provide additional information about yourself, some of which is stored in a WHOIS record once the domain has been set up.

WHOIS is a protocol that allows anyone to look up information about a domain, IP address or subnet. One of the most common functions of WHOIS in threat infrastructure research is to identify or connect disparate entities based on unique data shared in WHOIS records. If you've read carefully or have ever purchased a domain yourself, you may have noticed that the content requested from registrars is never verified. In fact, you could have put anything in the record (and many people do) that would then be displayed to the world.

Each WHOIS record has a number of different sections, all of which can contain different information. The most common sections are "registrar", "registrant", "administrator" and "technical", each of which may correspond to a different contact for the registration. Most of the time, this data is duplicated in all sections, but in some cases there may be slight discrepancies, especially if an actor has made a mistake. When you look up the WHOIS information in PassiveTotal, you see a condensed record that duplicates all the data and indicates which part of the record it came from. We have found that this process greatly speeds up the analysts' workflow and also prevents any data from being missed. PassiveTotal's WHOIS information is powered by the RiskIQ WHOISIQ™ database.

### Example :
To carry out your research you have the possibility of using certain sites dedicated to that like: https://whois.domaintools.com/, but you can also do it via the terminal by typing the command whois.

## Subdomains

Discovering the subdomains of a domain is an essential part of hacking recognition, and thanks to the following online tools, that makes life easier.

Having an unsecured subdomain can pose a serious risk to your business, and lately there have been security incidents where the hacker has used subdomain tricks.

The most recent was the Vine site, where the entire code was available for download from an exposed vulnerable subdomain.

### DNS Dumpster
DNSDumpster is a domain lookup tool to find host related information. This is the HackerTarget.com project.

Not only the subdomain, but it gives you information about the DNS server, MX record, TXT record and a great mapping of your domain.

### Sublist3r
Sublist3r is a python tool for finding subdomains using a search engine. Currently it supports Google, Yahoo, Bing, Baidu, Ask, Netcraft, Virustotal, ThreatCrowd, DNSdumpster and PassiveDNS.

## Recon-ng 
link : https://github.com/lanmaster53/recon-ng  

Recon-ng is a full-featured reconnaissance framework designed with the goal of providing a powerful environment to conduct open source web-based reconnaissance quickly and thoroughly.

Recon-ng has a look and feel similar to the Metasploit Framework, reducing the learning curve for leveraging the framework. However, it is quite different. Recon-ng is not intended to compete with existing frameworks, as it is designed exclusively for web-based open source reconnaissance. If you want to exploit, use the Metasploit Framework. If you want to social engineer, use the Social-Engineer Toolkit. If you want to conduct reconnaissance, use Recon-ng! See the Wiki to get started.
