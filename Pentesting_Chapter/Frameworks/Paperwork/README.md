## Pentesting steps

* **Pre-engagement :** This is surely the phase that many novices will neglect/forget, wrongly, because it is during this phase that we will define the scope of the test and the methods that will be used for it.

* Reconnaissance : Collecting as much publically accessible informations about the target as possible.

* Enumeration/Scanning : Discover the applications and services running on the systems, scan the ports (it's time for nmap).

* Exploitation : Exploit vulnerabilities discovered on a system or application either via public exploits or via exploitation of the application/system logic.

* Privilege Escalation : Once you have successfully exploited a system or application, a foothold in the jargon, you need to extend your access to the system. We talk about horizontal and vertical escalation, horizontal escalation corresponds to a transition to another user with the same permissions, vertical escalation corresponds to access to admin permissions.

* Post-exploitation : This phase is broken down into several sub-steps:

    - Full privilege collection : Additional information with a high-privileged user.

    - Pivoting : Check of other potential targets.

    - Clean-up : Erase the traces of your intrusion.

    - Reporting : Report harvesters, the flaws that have been discovered, the methods used, the paths, the tools, the commands, or any other relevant information that can be used in the last phase.

    - Remediation : Fixing and proposing solutions for all vulnerabilities that were identified during the reporting phase.

## The mission

Pentesting is an activity that will ask you to perform security tests. Those tests must be legally framed in order to protect you. At each step of your pentest you must ask yourself if the action you're doing has been approved by the right person in the company.

Your mission will be to define workflows and templates of paper that you would use to conduct professional pentest. I know, it's not the most exiting part of pentesting but you need to protect yourself before acquiring legally punishable knowledges.

### Instructions

As stated above I will ask you to produce workflows of how you would conduct a pentesting.

Here are some questions that you should ask yourself :
- What are the steps of a standard pentest?
- Who are the people i'll be in contact with? What are their job titles? Are they "IT-minded"?
- What is the outcome of a pentest?
- What are the metrics that will be used to assess the pentest report?

Some attention points :
- Timing
- Test impact on business
- Risk indicators
- Commercialy speaking, providing a quote for each vuln fix might be a good idea

The result should be structured the following way :

- "Pentest Agreement"
- "Workflow Communication Schematics"
- "Pentest Report Agreement"
- Feel free to add any extension that you judge useful

The documents presented must look professional and must be reusable for different clients/pentests.

The goal here is to make you understand how to setup a lawful frame around your test procedure. It might be interesting for you to keep your results to reuse them once you start your pentester activity. 

The results will be presented at a general debrief.

# Congrats

Congratulations! I hope you understand how important it is to define precisely the scope in which you will perform your actions to avoid lawsuits! Paperwork will hopefully help you to avoid many legal/client issues!
