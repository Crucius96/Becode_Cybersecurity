## Pentesting steps

* **Pre-engagement :** This is surely the phase that many novices will neglect/forget, wrongly, because it is during this phase that we will define the scope of the test and the methods that will be used for it.

* Reconnaissance : Collecting as much publically accessible informations about the target as possible.

* Enumeration/Scanning : Discover the applications and services running on the systems, scan the ports (it's time for nmap).

* Exploitation : Exploit vulnerabilities discovered on a system or application either via public exploits or via exploitation of the application/system logic.

* Privilege Escalation : Once you have successfully exploited a system or application, a foothold in the jargon, you need to extend your access to the system. We talk about horizontal and vertical escalation, horizontal escalation corresponds to a transition to another user with the same permissions, vertical escalation corresponds to access to admin permissions.

* Post-exploitation : This phase is broken down into several sub-steps:

    - Full privilege collection : Additional information with a high-privileged user.

    - Pivoting : Check of other potential targets.

    - Clean-up : Erase the traces of your intrusion.

    - Reporting : Report harvesters, the flaws that have been discovered, the methods used, the paths, the tools, the commands, or any other relevant information that can be used in the last phase.

    - Remediation : Fixing and proposing solutions for all vulnerabilities that were identified during the reporting phase.

## The mission

Penetration testing is a security assessment methodology. Since security can apply to multiple domain (webapp, mobile, infrastructure, ...), it seems logical that we have multiple tools, multiple frameworks! 

In this briefing, you will discover those frameworks that will become your bibles.

I would suggest to start with these :
- [OSSTMM](https://www.isecom.org/OSSTMM.3.pdf)
- [NIST 800-115](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-115.pdf)
- [PTES](http://www.pentest-standard.org/index.php/PTES_Technical_Guidelines)
- OWASP
    - [Web Application](https://github.com/OWASP/wstg/tree/master/document)
    - [Firmware](https://github.com/scriptingxss/owasp-fstm)
    - [Mobile Security](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-masvs)
    - [Mobile Application Security](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg)
- [Penetration Testing Framework 0.59](http://www.vulnerabilityassessment.co.uk/Penetration%20Test.html)
- [ISSAF](https://sourceforge.net/projects/isstf/files/issaf%20document/issaf0.1/)

### Instructions

>I would recommend you to keep your results clean and safe since we will try to make you do essential cheatsheets that will probably be useful during your pentester carreer!

- Check the links provided above. Try to not spend too much time in the content, try to have a global view. The summary should be a good place to start.
- Look for other frameworks covering other application areas
- Try to make a table containing frameworks and their application domains (there might be some overlap over there). The goal here is to know which framework will help you for each situation. Having a cheatsheet should be pretty handy.


## Congrats

Congratulation! You made your first steps in the pentesting world! The references you're discovering now should follow you along your carreer so keep track of it!
