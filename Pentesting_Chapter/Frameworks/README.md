## Pentesting steps

* **Pre-engagement :** This is surely the phase that many novices will neglect/forget, wrongly, because it is during this phase that we will define the scope of the test and the methods that will be used for it.

* Reconnaissance : Collecting as much publically accessible informations about the target as possible.

* Enumeration/Scanning : Discover the applications and services running on the systems, scan the ports (it's time for nmap).

* Exploitation : Exploit vulnerabilities discovered on a system or application either via public exploits or via exploitation of the application/system logic.

* Privilege Escalation : Once you have successfully exploited a system or application, a foothold in the jargon, you need to extend your access to the system. We talk about horizontal and vertical escalation, horizontal escalation corresponds to a transition to another user with the same permissions, vertical escalation corresponds to access to admin permissions.

* Post-exploitation : This phase is broken down into several sub-steps:

    - Full privilege collection : Additional information with a high-privileged user.

    - Pivoting : Check of other potential targets.

    - Clean-up : Erase the traces of your intrusion.

    - Reporting : Report harvesters, the flaws that have been discovered, the methods used, the paths, the tools, the commands, or any other relevant information that can be used in the last phase.

    - Remediation : Fixing and proposing solutions for all vulnerabilities that were identified during the reporting phase.

## So ?

In this module, we will see the different methodology available that you will use while pentesting. This will contain the most important resources that you will use during your carreer as a pentester. 

We will start with the frameworks that will be your tools during your pentester journey. Then we will see how to protect yourself from lawsuit with the paperwork that you should foresee before starting any pentest.
